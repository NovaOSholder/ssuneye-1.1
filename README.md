# How to install it on Linux Debian-based systems?

First, open terminal and type this: ```sudo apt-get update```

Then, ```sudo apt-get install git```
Next, ```sudo apt-get install python3```

Now we installed Git and Python
Now, we are gonna install NLTK and TextBlob.
To install NLTK and TextBlob, we are going to use Pip instead of APT to download it.

Type: ```pip install nltk```
Next, ```pip install textblob```

Now we installed NLTK and Textblob, now we are gonna open the ssuneye-1.1 folder and run the main script.

Type: ```cd ssuneye-1.1```
Then, ```python3 __compile__.py```

Yes, we  installed ssuneye completely, but! its not much advanced version. So you need to type normally.

For example: Don't type ```Hello! Who is Elon Musk``` instead, type ```who is elon musk```
